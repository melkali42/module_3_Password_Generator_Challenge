# <Password Generator>

## Purpose

Using a random password generator is useful and can provide a greater security for the protection of personal and sensitive data that a user is trying to access. The structural makeup of this password generator used HTML for markups, CSS to style to content of the page, and JavaScript was used to program the functional behavior of the website to generate a random password through a series of inputs and prompts. The specific criteria that was used included having a password between 8 and 128 characters, which were made up of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and /or special characters. Each propmpt validated each choice of characters that were used and the generated password matches the specific required criteria.
